2. On Table 2. Heart failure patients with history of hypertension characteristics – is it possible to expand the table add
   a description of the patient's comorbidities per reviewer's request? 
   Would you be able to provide details with which comorbid conditions you used in the analysis and numbers/percentages for each condition.

3. The mean age of the patients was 74.9 +/- 14.1 years. The reviewer has suggested a sub-analysis or stratification by age. 
   The inclusion criteria included patients 18 and older with history of HTN. The latter makes the distribution skewed, 
   considering that out of 51000 patients only a few would be younger than 40 y.o. The results presumably will be different for those 
   a)younger than 75, b)those between 75-84 and c)85 and older. Please let me know what is the best way to do this.
